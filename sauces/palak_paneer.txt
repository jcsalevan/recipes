        another 30-45 secs just about when the tomatoes start to get watery turn off and the contents to the blender which 
        already has the pureed spinach leaves. Puree for a min.

Step 3: Warm butter in same pan at medium heat and fry finely chopped chilies, add the pureed mixture into the pan wash the 
        remaining sau in the blennder with half a cup of water and dump it in to the pan. Add garam-masala, salt, chili powder 
        (optional) and corriander powder stir them in and lid it. Allow the sauce to come to a light boil then add sour cream 
        you'll see the sause lighten in color, add cubed cottage cheese, lid it reduce heat to low and cook for 8-10 mins.
