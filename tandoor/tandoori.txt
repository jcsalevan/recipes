TANDOORI - Grill sauce (red)
----------------------------

The quantities mentioned below is what I use to marinate 4 chicken thighs

1     cup   yogurt
2     tbsp  kashmiri chili powder (mildly spicy gives the red color)
1/2   tbsp  red chili powder (paprika)
1     tbsp  salt
2     tbsp  ginger garlic paste
3/4   tbsp  fenel seeds ground
1/2   tbsp  cumin powder
3     tbsp  onion powder
1/4   tbsp  chat masala
1     tbsp  garam masala
1     tbsp  corriander powder
1/4   tbsp  cinnamon salt/powder
1/4   tbsp  nutmeg powder
1/4   tbsp  turmeric powder
pinch of    white pepper

2   chicken breasts cubed
         !! OR !!
4   pices Chicken thighs
         !! OR !!
1   pack  Paneer (indian cottage cheese) 

Optional: 1/4   tbsp  Aamchoor powder (Dried sour mango powder)


Method:

Mix all the ingredients in a bowl. Dont mind geeting your hands and fingers dirty they need a nice mix.
Preferably dont wear a white apron/T-shirt unless you want it stained. Once the mixture is throughtly mixed,
it should have the consistancy of a cake batter mix. Taste it because its hard to approximate the spices
because the quality of spices differ and also sometimes the heat in chili powder. If what you taste is something
similar to chetos minus the sweetness (slightly tangy because of yogurt, spicy because of the masala and chili 
powder) then you have the right marinade.

Make shallow slits on chicken thighs, pour the mixture in to a ziploc bag along with the chicken pices. Get 
the air out lock it give it a nice rub and sit in fridge overnight or for 2 hrs minimum. 

---------------------------   OR  -----------------------------

Put the chicken pieces in the same bowl mix it (dont be shy to use your hands) and put it in the fridge without 
covering. The marinade gets dehydrarted and sticks to the meat forming a nice layer. 
*** This is what I prefer ***


##  Thaw to room temp before grilling. 
##  Chicken Thighs can be substituted with chicken breast cubes or paneer
##  You would want to use skewers if you are using breast pieces or paneer
##  When you think the chicken is done paint it with a mixture of 
    butter+aamchoor(mentioned as optional)+chat masala
##  Serve with lemons and onion slices that were soaked in lime juice+ salt
