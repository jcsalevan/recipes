Hariyali - Green grill sauce
----------------------------

This the below mentioned quantities are sufficiwent to marinate 4 pices of chicken thighs

1/2    bunch  mint leaves
1/2    bunch  cilantro
2-3           green chilies (depending on your spice preference)
1/2    tbsp   ginger-garlic paste
1      tbsp   lime juice
1      tbsp   salt
2      tbsp   onion powder
2      tbsp   yogurt

Optional: 1/4   tbsp  Aamchoor powder (Dried sour mango powder)

Method:

In a blender puree the mint leaves, cilatro and green chiles along with lime juice. Add water just sufficient to
puree the mixture. You dont want to have runny/watery paste. Mix the pureed mixture along with rest of the ingredients
in a bowl. you should end up with something that is of cake batter consistensy, tangy and a bit on the spicier side.

Marinate as described in Tandoori. (I prefer the second method)


##  The marinade can be a little spicy but when cooked the meat balances it
##  Thaw to room temp before grilling. 
##  Chicken Thighs can be substituted with chicken breast cubes or paneer
##  You would want to use skewers if you are using breast pieces or paneer
##  When you think the chicken is done paint it with a mixture of 
    butter+aamchoor(mentioned as optional)+chat masala
