Chicken Kebabs - Deep fried marinated chicken
----------------------------------------

This is the non traditional recipe. But it has always worked for me.
Personally the flavors are much better than the traditional one.

Ingredients:

Same as Tandoori.
Use breast pieces or leg pieces.

Method:

After marination, deep fry the chicken untill the outerlayer is brown and crispy.
Some slits on the chicken ensure that the chicken is cooked well to the bone.
