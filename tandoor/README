Tandoor/Tandoori in Hindi or Urdu means charcoal oven which basically is a clay cylindrical structure
on the inside lined with mortor on the outside to insulate heat. In simple terms they are similar to small 
sized kilns with an opening on the top. Though Indian food is all about sauces, rice and bread tandoor style 
of cooking is a vital part of Indian Cuisine as some parts of India still rely on firewood and charcoal for 
their cooking needs.

These dishes have meat or paneer (indian cottage cheese) as base which are marinated with some kind of sauce 
overinight. You can use a charcoal grill with lid on for best results. Else gas grill or ovens (least recomended 
unless you have broil). All you need is some wodden skewers soaked in water or metal skewers and you are good to go.

If using a grill either charcoal/gas its straight forward. Cook ntill the meat is cooked. Use a thermometer if need be
While cooking paneer oil the grill liberally because they tend to cling on to it. Minced meat requires slightly leseer
cooking time comaperd to chicken thighs. 

*****   In oven bake at 325F till about 40% done and change the   ***** 
        settings to broil at 400-500F to complete the cooking 
        while turning the meat on the skewer to get an even 
        cook.  
        
        CAUTION: If you over look during broil you can 
                 easily overcook the meat.
