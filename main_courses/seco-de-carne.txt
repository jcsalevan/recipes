Seco de Carne
--------------
.5 cup vegetable oil (enough to sear the beef)
1.5 pounds boneless beef chuck roast, cut in 2Ã—2 inch pieces
1 chopped red onion
2 chopped garlic cloves
2 anaheim chilis, seeded
1 serrano/jalapeno chili (optional for heat)
3 cups cilantro leaves (one bunch)
2 cups spinach (one bunch)
2 potatoes (or yucca), cut in four parts
.75 cup frozen green peas
.75 cup diced carrots
Salt and pepper to taste


1. Heat the oil in a saucepan over high heat, and when it is very hot sear the beef pieces on each side until they are golden brown.
2. Put the cilantro, spinach, and anaheim chilis in the blender and process with one cup water. Reserve.
3. Add the onions and garlic to the saucepan; stir and let them cook until the onions are soft and translucent.
4. Pour the cilantro mix and turn the heat to medium heat. Stir constantly until the water evaporates.
5. Add one tablespoon of oil, if necessary, to fry the herbs. The cilantro and spinach are going to get a dark green color.
6. Pour 6 cups of water and simmer over medium-low heat for 2 hours with the lid on. Check constantly and add water if necessary.
7. When the meat is fork tender add the potatoes, green peas and carrots; cook uncovered for 15 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.
8. The stew is ready when the veggies are cooked and the juice is reduced.
9. Serve with rice and beans.
